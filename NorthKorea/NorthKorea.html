                <article>The first recorded kingdom (Choson) on the Korean Peninsula dates from approximately 2300 B.C.
                    Over
                    the subsequent centuries, three main kingdoms -- Kogoryo, Paekche, and Silla -- were established on
                    the Peninsula. By the 5th century A.D., Kogoryo emerged as the most powerful, with control over much
                    of the Peninsula and part of Manchuria (modern-day northeast China). However, Silla allied with the
                    Chinese to create the first unified Korean state in 688. Following the collapse of Silla in the 9th
                    century, Korea was unified under the Koryo (Goryeo; 918-1392) and the Chosen (Joseon; 1392-1910)
                    dynasties. Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry among the Chinese (its
                    traditional benefactor), Japanese, and Russian empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th
                    centuries. After the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), Korea was
                    occupied by Imperial Japan. In 1910, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. After World War
                    II, the northern half came under Soviet-sponsored communist control.</article>
                <article>In 1948, North Korea (formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) was
                    founded under President KIM Il Sung, who consolidated power and cemented autocratic one-party rule
                    under the Korean Worker's Party (KWP). North Korea failed to conquer UN-backed South Korea (formally
                    the Republic of Korea or ROK) during the Korean War (1950-53), after which a demilitarized zone
                    separated the two Koreas. KIM's authoritarian rule included tight control over North Korean citizens
                    and the demonization of the US as the central threat to North Korea's political and social system.
                    In addition, he molded the country's economic, military, and political policies around the core
                    objective of unifying Korea under Pyongyang's control. North Korea also declared a central ideology
                    of juche ("self-reliance") as a check against outside influence, while continuing to rely heavily on
                    China and the Soviet Union for economic support. KIM Il Sung's son, KIM Jong Il, was officially
                    designated as his father's successor in 1980, and he assumed a growing political and managerial role
                    until the elder KIM's death in 1994. Under KIM Jong Il's reign, North Korea continued developing
                    nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. KIM Jong Un was publicly unveiled as his father's successor
                    in 2010. Following KIM Jong Il's death in 2011, KIM Jong Un quickly assumed power and has since
                    occupied the regime's highest political and military posts.</article>
                <article>
                    After the end of Soviet aid in 1991, North Korea faced serious economic setbacks that exacerbated
                    decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation. Since the mid-1990s, North Korea has
                    faced chronic food shortages and economic stagnation. In recent years, the North's domestic
                    agricultural production has improved but still falls far short of producing sufficient food for its
                    population. Starting in 2002, North Korea began to tolerate semi-private markets but has made few
                    other efforts to meet its goal of improving the overall standard of living. New economic development
                    plans in the 2010s failed to meet government-mandated goals for key industrial sectors, food
                    production, or overall economic performance. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, North
                    Korea instituted a nationwide lockdown that severely restricted its economy and international
                    engagement. Since then, KIM has repeatedly expressed concerns with the regime's economic failures
                    and food problems, but in 2021, he vowed to continue "self-reliant" policies and has reinvigorated
                    his pursuit of greater regime control of the economy.

                    As of 2024, despite slowly renewing cross-border trade with China, North Korea remained one of the
                    world's most isolated countries and one of Asia's poorest. In 2024, Pyongyang announced it was
                    ending all economic cooperation with South Korea. The move followed earlier proclamations that it
                    was scrapping a 2018 military pact with South Korea to de-escalate tensions along their militarized
                    border, abandoning the country’s decades-long pursuit of peaceful unification with South Korea, and
                    designating the South as North Korea’s “principal enemy.”
